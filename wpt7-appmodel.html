Hi, i got problem with my PC. Every few starts in event viewer i get kernel-power and appmodel-runtime errors. There isnt any bluescreen or something. PC runs normally but get this errors.

Hi all, As you will see in my future posts, I’m a big fan of the application model in ConfigMgr 2012. The AppModel offers several interesting features to deploy your applications to your clients. So let's say we have a single Application with two Deployment Types, one for x64 and one for x86, is it okay to have a circular reference on the x64 Deployment Type to require the installation of the x86 Deployment Type first, before installing the x64 version? For this example, let's use the Visual C++ Redist for x86 and and x64. For this to work properly, I would say you have to split the x86 version and x64 into two different Applications and not have it in the same Application. Thoughts?. I’ve been meaning to learn the Rust language for quite some years and found only now the time to start this endeavor. I must say it has probably been for the best, as the language has clearly matured a lot since the last time I looked 
In my reflex app I use `ReaderT` to share the config everywhere. Nice. Now I want to store an authentication token, that the server returns for a valid name/password combination of a user. The token must be sent as header in the subsequent XHRs. Instead of passing it around as a parameter, I'd like to share the token throughout all the app just like the config. But how can this be done? I was thinking of `StateT` or `Control.Monad.Trans.RWS`, but both of them force one into the hell of `lift`.  All DLL files available for free download.
